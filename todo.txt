Check for available TIX before sale

Error handling in getone api and corresponding UI
Return tix and sol on failed transaction
Update UI based on errors

There is an edge case here that we may have to handle manually through customer support.
The payment from user wallet to store wallet is sent but the confirmation call times out. In that case, we are not transferring the NFT.



Nate:

!!! Confirm alert for GetOne before actual purchase

 mui > components > override  https://mui.com/customization/theme-components/#global-style-overrides

Infosign and features offers fonts fixes working correctly?

Cost in featured collections fix the TIKI TIX section of the background seperated from the other part of the bar, so that the aspect ratio is maintained

check that Favicon & Window title (in tab) is working

ellipses when featured offer collection name is too long

min font size for infosign

_______
   Features

!!!  Whitelist for the collections which are being shown, getOne only  grabs from these

Every so often, send off anything outside of the whitelist to another wallet for later processing
